At first glance, the structure of the page follows a certain patern consisting in 2 different areas: "HEAD" and "BODY". At this point of the course there's not much I can explain technically, however, most of the lines in the "BODY" part are the ones who give the "characteristics" of the words in the page, such as size, font, position, and a hyperlink depending of the case.

In the hn.js file, I can infer that most of the code in it consists of Events and Triggers for the behaviour of the whole page and its respective parts. On the other hand, the news.css file contain the "visua" aspects of the whole page, such as font, size, colour and position of every word, with the characteristics of the background.

The browser took 7 different resources to load the page. On every resource the request method was "GET", which its function is to retrieve data by requesting a representation of the specified resource.
